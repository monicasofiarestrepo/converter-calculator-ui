## üìå API Behavior Note

While integrating the currency recommendation endpoint, I found that **requests below a certain amount (in COP) return no data**.

For instance:

- This request returns an empty result:
  ```
  amount=1000.0
  https://74j6q7lg6a.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/stage/orderbook/public/recommendations?type=1&cryptoCurrencyId=TATUM-TRON-USDT&fiatCurrencyId=COP&amount=1000.0&amountCurrencyId=COP
  ‚Üí {"data": {}}
  ```

- But this one returns a valid response:
  ```
  amount=20000.0
  https://74j6q7lg6a.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/stage/orderbook/public/recommendations?type=1&cryptoCurrencyId=TATUM-TRON-USDT&fiatCurrencyId=COP&amount=20000.0&amountCurrencyId=COP
  ‚Üí {"data": { byPrice: {...}, ... }}
  ```

From the successful response, it‚Äôs clear that the `limits.fiat.minLimit` is **18938.2**, meaning the API only returns conversion data when the requested amount meets or exceeds this minimum.

Consider this behaviour to exchange small quantities of a currency.
